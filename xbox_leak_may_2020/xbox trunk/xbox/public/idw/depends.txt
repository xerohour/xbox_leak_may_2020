What's New in Version 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Detection of dynamically loaded modules, including details about which module
   actually called LoadLibrary to dynamically load the module.
*  Detection of dynamically called functions, including details about which
   module actually called GetProcAddress() to obtain the function address.
*  Detection of delay-load dependencies. This is a new type of dependency that
   was introduced with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. They work on Windows 9x,
   Windows NT, and Windows 2000.
*  Support for 64-bit Windows modules.
*  Console mode that allows Dependency Walker to be ran without its graphical
   interface being displayed.  This is useful for batch files and unattended
   automation of Dependency Walker features.
*  Command line options to configure module search order, column sorting, output
   files, profiling, and other settings.
*  Ability to monitor module entrypoints (like DllMain) looking for module
   initialization failures.
*  C++ function name undecorating to provide human readable C++ function
   prototypes including function names, return types, and parameter types.
*  User definable module search paths with support for "KnownDLLs" and the
   "App Paths" registry keys.  Search paths can be saved and loaded from within
   the graphical interface or from the command line.
*  Ability to save a module's session to a text report file for easy viewing in
   any text viewer.
*  Ability to save a module's session to a comma separated value (CSV) file for
   easy importing into other applications.
*  Ability to save a snapshot of a module's session to an image file, which can
   be loaded by Dependency Walker at a later time on any computer.
*  Module profiling to detect dynamic dependencies, child processes, thread
   activity, and exceptions. Child processes can also be profiled for their
   dependencies.
*  Ability to control what file extensions Dependency Walker will add the
   "View Dependencies" menu item to a file's context menu in explorer.
*  Added hotkeys to help match imports with exports, and modules in the list
   view with modules in the tree view.  Also added a hotkeys to locate the
   previous, next, or original instance of a module in the tree view.
*  Added some new columns to the Module List View. They include Link Time Stamp,
   Link Checksum, Real Checksum, Symbols, Actual Base, Virtual Size, and Load
   Order.
*  Added an OS Information dialog. This information is also saved to text and
   DWI files.
*  All list views can now be sorted by icon, which provides an easy way of
   grouping items of similar type.
*  You can now search all list views for text by simply typing in a few
   characters to match in the currently sorted column.
*  Added color-coding to the module list view and log view to help highlight
   problems.
