        To detect state of Switch, either Open of Close, you can connect wires like below.<br>
        <p align="center"><img src="SwInput.jpg" alt="SwInput.jpg (18189 bytes)" width="640"
        height="320"></p>
        <p><br>
        <br>
        You can know if switch is open or closed by simply calling <em>InPort()</em> function of
        ActiveWire API.<br>
        In above&nbsp; Pull Down wiring, the <em>InPort()</em> function reads binary 0 when the
        switch is open, 1 when it is closed.<br>
        In above&nbsp; Pull Up wiring, the <em>InPort()</em> function reads binary 1 when the
        switch is open, 0 when it is closed.<br>

        Output pins of ActiveWire USB board is rated as 2.4V at 1.6mA Source, or 0.8V at 1.6mA
        Sink.&nbsp; <br>
        There is a 47ohm resistor in series in each pin to protect from excessive current.<br>
        According to my experiments, each output pin of ActiveWire USB board can drive 1 LED
        directly.<br>
        <br>
        To turn on and off more bigger load, such as relay or motor, you can use a MOSFET.<br>
        <br>
        <p align="center"><img src="MOSFETOut.jpg" alt="MOSFETOut.jpg (24576 bytes)" width="640"
        height="480"></p>
        <p><br>
        Please note that load has to be connected at Drain side and Source has to be grounded
        because of required Vgs to turn on the MOSFET.<br>
        <br>
        In this example, the relay is On when output pin is logical High, the relay is Off when
        the pin is logical Low.<br>
        <br>
        2N7000 used in this example can drive up to 60V 200mA continuous, or 500mA pulsed. <br>

        Using optoisolator, you can connect ActiveWire USB board and your device in two
        electrically isolated circuits,&nbsp; so it can be more robust with noise and flexible in
        voltage and current requirement.&nbsp; <br>

            All of the current ActiveWire USB software have been tested and verified on Windows-95
            with the USB Supplement released from Microsoft in April 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Please check if your USB host controller is recognized by Windows-95 correctly.<br>
            From <em>Start</em> menu, choose <em>Settings</em>, <em>Control Panel</em>, then double
            click on <em>System</em> icon.&nbsp; Choose <em>Device Manager</em> tab, then scroll
            window and find <em>Universal serial bus controller</em> item.&nbsp; Click on <em>+</em>
            sign in the beginning of the line, then if you see <em>USB Host Controller</em> and <em>USB
            Root Hub</em>, your system has a very good chance to work with ActiveWire USB board.<br>
            <br>
            If you do not see any of above in the <em>Device Manager</em>, and/or if you have any
            difficulties in using ActiveWire USB software, please try installing the USB Supplement
            for Windows-95 (<a href="http://www.ActiveWireInc.com/download/Win95USBSupp.exe"><u>click
            here to download</u></a>).<br>
            <br>
            If you still have problem, please contact technical support of the vendor of your USB host
            controller for any known compatibility issues, and/or contact our technical support, <a
            href="mailto:tech_support@ActiveWireInc.com">tech_support@ActiveWireInc.com</a>.<br>
            <br>
            ActiveWire will continue to support Windows-95 as best as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
            since Microsoft will no longer provide any enhancement on Windows-95 product,&nbsp; it may
            not be able to fix when a problem is found in future.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is suggested for all
            customers to migrate to the latest Windows-98 environment.<br>

            <br>
            Windows 2000 is supported with ActiveWire USB driver ver.1.04 and newer.&nbsp; <br>
            Since Windows 2000 is not officially released from Microsoft yet, ActiveWire only supports
            as Beta version.<br>
            <br>
            Following issues are currently known.&nbsp;&nbsp; These will be fixed in future versions
            of ActiveWire USB driver.<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Windows 2000 has a feature that it saves the driver information file (.INF) in the
                hidden system folder,<a href="file:///C:/WINNT/INF"> C:\WINNT\INF</a>,&nbsp; when the
                first time a new hardware is installed.&nbsp; Next time when user tries to update the
                driver, Windows 2000 system uses the saved INF file to install updated driver.
                &nbsp;&nbsp; This feature prevents proper install of updated driver if the INF file itself
                is updated.<br>
                If you experienced difficulty installing ActiveWire driver in Windows 2000 environment,
                please try either of followings ;<ol>
                  <li>With Windows Explorer, search the file containing text &quot;ActiveWire&quot; in&nbsp; <a
                    href="file:///C:/WINNT/INF">C:\WINNT\INF</a> folder.&nbsp; You may need to set option to
                    actually view the folder since it is hidden system folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The file is usually
                    named such as &quot;oem#.inf&quot;, where # is a 1digit number like 0,1,2, ....&nbsp; If
                    you can find it, delete the file, and try update the driver using Hardware Wizard.</li>
                  <li>Download <a href="http://www.ActiveWireInc.com/download/RegClear.exe">RegClear.exe</a>
                    utility and run in Windows 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of extra security feature of&nbsp;
                    Windows 2000 system, the utility cannot clear all the registry information.&nbsp; You have
                    to manually update/uninstall driver using Hardware Wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp; This utility
                    removes the saved INF file in <a href="file:///C:/WINNT/INF">C:\WINNT\INF</a> folder, so
                    tht when you try updating&nbsp; driver, it will not use the saved old INF file.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>After the ActiveWire USB driver software is successfully installed in Windows 2000, an
                error occurs with the message in blue screen like ;<br>
                <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** STOP 0x0000009F (0x00000100,
                0xFFAD3AD0, 0xFFAD3AD0, 0xFFAD3AD0)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE<br>
                </em>This happens only when Windows 2000 tries to shutdown/restart and&nbsp; the
                ActiveWire USB board is still plugged in to the host USB port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                This is a problem of the current ActiveWire USB driver.&nbsp; It will be fixed in future
                version.<br>
                <br>
                <strong><u>NOTE: This problem has been fixed with ActiveWire USB driver set ver.1.04B.</u></strong><br>

            There are 2 ways to use ActiveWire DLL in Microsoft Visual C++ ;<ol>
              <li>Statically load DLL</li>
              <li>Dynamically load DLL</li>
            </ol>
            <p><br>
            Please refer to the source code of sample application for example of statically load DLL.
            &nbsp; (available for download as <em>AwusbIOSrc.exe</em>, <a
            href="http://www.ActiveWireInc.com/download/AwusbIOexeSrc.exe"><u>click here</u> to
            download now</a>.)<br>
            <br>
            To statically load DLL, you need to link your application with <em>awusb.lib</em> file,
            which is included in <em>lib\</em> directory of the sample application source code.
            &nbsp;&nbsp; From the menu bar,&nbsp; choose <em>Project</em>, <em>Settings</em>, then
            click on <em>Link</em> tab.&nbsp; Type in <em>&quot;..\lib\awusb.lib&quot;</em> in the
            window right below <em>Object/library modules</em>.<br>
            In your C++ source code, include <em>AwusbApi.h</em> file, call <em>LoadLibrary()</em>
            function with the name of DLL.&nbsp; The name of ActiveWire USB API DLL, <em>awusb.lib</em>,
            is defined as a macro, <em>AWUSB_DLL_NAME</em>, in the header file.<br>
            <br>
            ex)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>#include &quot;AwusbApi.h&quot;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .....<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            // Load DLL library<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            LoadLibrary (AWUSB_DLL_NAME);</em><br>
            <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .....<br>
            <br>
            </em><br>
            Then, you are free to call any of the DLL functions anywhere in your C++ code.<br>
            <br>
            Please note that you have to at least re-link your application with <em>awusb.lib</em>
            when <em>awusb.dll</em> has been updated.&nbsp; <em>awusb.lib</em> and <em>awusb.dll</em>
            will be always updated together.<br>
            <br>
            To avoid re-linking with <em>awusb.lib</em>, you can choose to dynamically load DLL,
            calling <em>GetProcAddress()</em> function.&nbsp; Please refer to Microsoft Visual C++
            Reference Manual for more detail.<br>

            </a><br>
            There are 2 ways to write an ActiveWire application in Microsoft Visual Basic.<ol>
              <li>Use DLL</li>
              <li>Use OCX </li>
            </ol>
            <p><br>
            Please refer to the sample Visual Basic projects. (available for download as <em>VBSampleDLL.exe</em>
            or <em>VBSampleOCX.exe</em>, <a href="http://www.ActiveWireInc.com/download.htm">click
            here</a> to download now.)<br>
            <br>
            Because the calling convention of functions in C/C++ and Basic is different, there is a
            separate DLL specifically for Visual Basic users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been named as <em>awusbvb.dll</em>
            as opposed to the one for MCVC++.&nbsp;&nbsp; It provides the exactly same functionality.<br>
            <br>
            Instead of using DLL, using OCX&nbsp; may provide more convenient and versatile interface
            to ActiveWire products in Visual Basic application.&nbsp;&nbsp; OCX, or often called
            ActiveX Control, is another form of library module in Microsoft Windows environment.
            &nbsp;&nbsp; OCX provides common interface to most of popular programming language, such
            as Visual Basic and C++,&nbsp; and scripting language recently introduced, such as
            JavaScript.&nbsp;&nbsp; As same effort as writing an application in Visual Basic, you can
            write HTML file that can be browsed by Internet browser and still you can use
            functionality of ActiveWire products using&nbsp; JavaScript and OCX.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            This idea of using Internet browser as a programming platform saves your time and effort
            of trial and error in application development.<br>
            <br>
            If you like the idea,&nbsp; please use OCX as ActiveWire interface!!<br>

            sample source code</a> written in MSVC++.&nbsp;&nbsp; This sample runs in DOS propmt, and
            uses no Microsoft specific library.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also it demonstrate how to explicitly call
            DLL function from application.&nbsp; Explicit call of DLL allows no need to link with
            Awusb.lib file so that the source code can be compiled and link with development tools
            other than MSVC++.<br>
            <br>
            Following is found in the Borland C++ 3's Online Help.<br>
            <br>
            A Windows DLL can be used by a C++Builder application just as it would be by any C++
            application.<br>
            To statically load a DLL when your C++Builder application is loaded, link the import
            library file for that DLL into your C++Builder application at link time. To add an import
            library to a C++Builder application, open the make file (.BPR) for the application and add
            the import library name to the library file list assigned to the ALLLIB variable. If
            necessary, add the path of the import library to the path(s) listed for the <em>-L</em>
            option of LFLAGS (linker options) variable.<br>
            <br>
            The exported functions of that DLL then become available for use by your application.
            Prototype the DLL functions your application uses with <em>__declspec(dllimport)</em>
            modifier:<br>
            <br>
            <em>__declspec(dllimport)</em> <em>return_type imported_function_name(parameters);</em><br>
            <br>
            To dynamically load a DLL during the run of a C++Builder application use the Windows API
            function <em>LoadLibrary()</em> to load the DLL, then use the API function <em>GetProcAddress()</em>
            to obtain pointers to the individual functions you wish to use.<br>
            <br>
            Additional information on using DLLs can be found in the Microsoft® Win32 SDK Reference.<br>

            Here's a <a href="http://www.ActiveWireInc.com/download/AwusbIODelphi.exe">samle source
            code</a> using Delphi.<br>
            <br>
            Following is found in the Delphi 4's Online Help.<br>
            <br>
            Before you can call routines defined in a DLL, you must import them. This can be done in
            two ways: by declaring an external procedure or function, or by calling the Windows API
            directly. Whichever method you use, the routines are not linked to your application until
            runtime. This means that the DLL need not be present when you compile your program. It
            also means that there is no compile-time validation of attempts to import a routine.<br>
            <br>
            Object Pascal does not support importing of variables from DLLs.<br>
            <br>
            Static loading<br>
            <br>
            The simplest way to import a procedure or function is to declare it using the external
            directive. For example,<br>
            <br>
            <em>procedure DoSomething; external 'MYLIB.DLL';</em><br>
            <br>
            If you include this declaration in a program, MYLIB.DLL is loaded once, when the program
            starts. Throughout execution of the program, the identifier DoSomething always refers to
            the same entry point in the same DLL.<br>
            <br>
            Declarations of imported routines can be placed directly in the program or unit where they
            are called. To simplify maintenance, however, you can collect external declarations into a
            separate &#147;import unit&#148; that also contains any constants and types required for
            interfacing with the DLL. (Delphi&#146;s Windows unit is a good example.) Other modules
            that use the import unit can call any routines declared in it.<br>
            <br>

            There are several USB host controller chips reportedly cause problems with any USB devices
            in certain occasions. <br>
            The problems have been most often observed with systems such as either ;<ol>
              <li>manufactured sometime between 1997 to early 1998. (including some big-brand laptops)</li>
              <li>low cost machines (such as less than $500) that may use out-of-date components </li>
            </ol>
            <p><br>
            If your ActiveWire USB board does not work well on your system for any reason, please
