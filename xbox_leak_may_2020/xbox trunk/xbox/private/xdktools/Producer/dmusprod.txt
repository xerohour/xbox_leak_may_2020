DirectMusic Producer for Xbox Beta 1

Hello and welcome to the Xbox Beta 1 release of DirectMusic Producer, the suite 
of authoring tools for DirectMusic and Xbox audio content.  This release introduces
some new Xbox-specific features not found in previous releases. Being a Beta 
release, there will be some issues and bugs to work around.  We'll apologize in 
advance.  

DirectMusic Producer for Xbox provides tools for both audio content authoring and
content auditioning on the Xbox audio hardware. It can be used solely for DLS
instrument management (triggered from an external sequencer) or for complete DirectMusic
content implementations. For details on these and other common authoring scenarios, please
visit Xbox Audio Designers Corner at https://xds.xbox.com

We hope that you will find DirectMusic to be an exciting technology to explore. DirectMusic
introduces modes of creating, playing and interacting with music that have never before
been possible.  Don't be daunted by the sheer number of ways you can approach musical
performance - most people find a few good techniques that fit their creative needs and
build from there.  Have fun!

Setup
-----
The Producer setup will automatically uninstall any existing versions of
Producer found on your machine. It's recommended that you close Producer 
before attempting to install. Producer requires the DirectX8 (or later) version of
DirectMusic, as Producer functionality is built entirely on top of DirectMusic.
(The Producer installation process will prompt you to install the DirectX8 runtime bits,
if they are not already present.)  

DirectMusic Producer also requires IE4.0 (or higher).  You can uninstall IE
after installing, as there are some system files that are required for
Producer.

DirectMusic Producer Performance 
--------------------------------
Note that Producer is generally memory-intensive because of all of the editing, display,
and undo information that is processed.  The overall authoring experience will be 
improved by having a machine with a significant amount of memory.  Note also that 
a DirectMusic runtime performance is much more efficient by comparison. You can use Xbox
Performance Monitor (provided with the Xbox Development Kit) to profile your runtime
performance on the actual Xbox console.

Demo8 Sample Content
--------------------
A project of sample content can be found on the XDK CD at 
"DMusProdX\DemoContent\dmpdemocontent.exe".  The project will install to 
"My Documents\DMUSProducer\Demo8\" on your hard drive. See Chapter 3 of the Audio Best
Practices document on Audio Designers Corner (at https://xds.xbox.com) for a discussion of
the features demonstrated in these samples that apply differently to the Xbox than the PC.

New in DirectMusic Producer for Xbox
------------------------------------
For features that make use of Xbox audio hardware, make sure your Xbox and your content
authoring PC are hooked up to the same network, or are using an Xbox System Link cable.
Your Xbox should be running the Audio Console App, supplied on the XDK recovery disk.

1. Microsoft Xbox Synthesizer
You can choose the Microsoft Xbox Synthesizer as your default synthesizer from the MIDI/
Performance Options menu (the icon that looks like a MIDI port). All note and DLS data
will be sent to an XDK running the Audio Console Application, so you can hear your content
played by the actual Xbox hardware. Note that in this mode, the DirectMusic 'performance'
is still running on your PC within DirectMusic Producer. The Xbox is only being used as a
hardware "MIDI" device, so data in wave tracks will not be played.

2. Xbox Experimenter
To physically copy data to the Xbox and hear it played by a DirectMusic performance running
on the actual hardware, use the Xbox Experimenter. You can open Xbox Experimenter from
DirectMusic Producer's "Add-Ins" menu. First enter the name of your XDK from the Xbox menu,
then choose 'Xbox > Connect'. You can then change the default directory for content to be
copied to if you wish. Now drag a segment from the project tree into the Primary Segments
or Secondary Segments frame of Experimenter. This copies the segment to the XDK, as well
as any content the segment references (which will be displayed in the 'Referenced Files'
frame). Click the small play button next to a segment to begin playing it. You can set
several options for a segment by right clicking on it. If you edit your content in
DirectMusic Producer, you should generally resynchronize it (via 'Synchronize') before
attempting to play on the Xbox.

3. "Configure Xbox Synthesizer..." menu option
You can choose to hear your content played on either the Xbox, the PC, or both
simultaneously for comparison purposes.

4. Removed PC and Unsupported Features
We have removed support for PC-specific features that do not apply to Xbox:
 Audiopaths / Parameter Control Tracks: For XSS v1.0, only standard audiopaths (stereo,
  stereo + reverb, 3D, etc.) are supported. Custom audiopath configurations (.aud) are not
  yet supported. Effects DSP programs can be authored using the XGPImage tool, separately
  shipped with your XDK. Your developer can then route your (standard) audiopath's output
  to an effects path. Realtime effects parameter manipulation should be performed by the
  developer for XSS v1.0. We intend to add realtime effects support and authoring to
  DirectMusic in a future release.

 Compression support in DLS and Wave Tracks: Support for general Windows codecs has been
  removed from DLS collection authoring and wave tracks. Only PCM and Xbox ADPCM are
  supported by the Xbox hardware. A future release will add software WMA support for
  wave tracks only.

 General MIDI/GS Instruments: Unlike Windows DirectX, Xbox does not have a hard-coded
  general MIDI DLS collection. Bands that attempt to use GM/GS instruments generate an
  error or warning on Xbox. We have now removed such instruments from menus that let you 
  set the 'patch change' for a performance channel.

 DLS Conditional Configurations: A feature designed to allow audio to scale based on the
  features available on a particular Windows machine, DLS Conditional Configurations do
  not apply to the fixed hardware of the Xbox and are therefore not supported. The
  configuration editor (in DLS Designer) is disabled, and the Conditional Configuration
  Audition Toolbar feature of DirectMusic Producer 8.0 has been removed.

Compression
-----------
 Xbox ADPCM does not support 8-bit source files.
 The DLS format is limited to mono compression only. However, waves placed in wave tracks
may use stereo Xbox ADPCM compression.

Can lead to performance problems:
---------------------------------
 Generally, it is bad practice to write script routines with large loops.  Doing so 
  could cause the routine to take a long time to execute.  If such a routine is used in 
  the script track, it could stall the performance, causing the segment뭩 playback to 
  stall or skip.  Once a routine is called, it is executed to completion - even if the 
  segment that triggered it (via a script track) is stopped.  If such a routine is called
  directly from the application, it could stall the application, preventing it from
  performing other important tasks
 Curve reset duration is longer than the curve's segment by default.  In most cases
  this will have no impact but if you have problems with reset values it's something to
  watch out for.  
 When there are tempo changes in the vicinity of a wave in a wave track (e.g., via 
  controlling segments or starting in the middle of a segment) wave playback may be
  affected if the segment is not played from the start.

Not intuitive:
--------------
 Lyrics and script error messages will not appear in the Message Window if the segment 
  playing does not have pchannel 1.  
 If any referenced segments in a segment trigger track fail to load, then the entire 
  track will fail to load (or play).  Likewise with wave tracks: if any referenced waves 
  fail to load the entire wave track will fail to load (or play).
 If wave edits are made in the Wave Editor while a segment references that wave in 
  a wave track, the wave could fall silent.  To work around this, force a redownload by
  stopping the segment and making another edit to the wave (alternately by reinitializing
  the performance by changing the sample rate of the synth).  
 Make sure to check "Super low latency" in MIDI/Performance Options before doing 
  Wave Export (in the Wave/MIDI Export Toolbar).
 Under certain circumstances recording, playback and/or cursor timing may become out of sync.
  A workaround is to change the default audiopath in the Transport Options Toolbar.
 The user can set latency for the DirectMusic synth in the MIDI/Performance Options dialog, 
  but DirectSound latency is added to this number and the combined latency is now displayed in 
  the Synth Status Toolbar.  Depending on the speed of your machine, it may take some tweaking 
  to find the point where latency is low enough for realtime input but high enough for solid 
  audio performance.  
 
Other Tips:
-----------
 You can usually switch to other music and sound applications without any
  conflicts by hitting the "toggle MIDI" button (it's in the Transport
  Options toolbar - the icon has music notes and is to the left of the MIDI 
  Options button).
 It is recommended that waves placed in DLS collections have sample rates
  between 188 Hz and 44 kHz. If a wave's sample rate happens to fall outside of
  these boundaries its pitch will be incorrect on playback on the Xbox (PC
  boundaries are different, generally a minimum of 4 kHz).
 Be very cautious when referencing files to external projects, as links can
  be easily broken (e.g., if the external project is not open at the 
  time that the referenced file is opened). 
 Watch out for MIDI files with GM or GS resets at the start of the file.
  Bands created from MIDI files are given a tick value of -1 (to start
  before the notes), and a GM/GS reset will override the band at that point.
 When two events are placed at exactly the same point in time, DirectMusic makes 
  no guarantee about which will occur first.  With this in mind, very often 
  Bands in segments should have a negative offset to ensure that the proper 
  instrument settings will occur before the note start times. By default, bands 
  inserted into segments will have a start time of -1 in relation to the beat.
